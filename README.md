# GmailScanner

The project uses the [Google GMail API](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/)
to parse and aggregate an authenticated user inbox information. 

The goal is to scan all emails under a certain email Label, collect the senders email and
feed the information to a Google Sheet.

## Why I Created This?
I recently completed the SWE (Software Engineering) interview process, and for the
ones who are familiar know this process is **DIFFICULT**!

For you that aren't, the interview process typically goes like this:
1. Apply for the Dream Role...and wait! ðŸ¤“
2. Lucky you! A recruiter (human) contacted you to learn more about you and how you'll fit @ the company.
3. You rocked it, now you'll speak with a engineer and solve coding challenges like [these!](https://leetcode.com/)
4. Smarty ðŸ‘–'s, now the company wants to bring you onsite for 5-6 interviews (coding, system design, behavioral).
5. You CRUSHED IT & THEY LOVE YOU! Now it's time for the OFFER ðŸ’¸!

I was fortunate enough to complete steps 1-5 a few times, but it NEVER would've happen without the 200+ times I didn't make it pass step 2. (REJECTION).

I kept all 200+ rejection emails for **motivation** AND so that I could build this email parser that automatically creates a spreadsheet containing recruiters contact information for candidates like YOU.

## Setup Google API Services
You'll need to create a Google Cloud Project and enable the Gmail API. [Here are the Steps](./setup_google.md)
